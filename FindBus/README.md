Bus transportation service has very poor transportation information system nowadays. Bus users
do not know the exact arrival time for a bus, but only know the scheduled approximate arrival
time. Bus transportation service does not have a proper system to track all buses position and the
actual arrival time in every bus stop. These problems occur because current bus service system
did not apply real time tracking technology to track on each bus on the road and also lack of a
platform to update latest bus traffic information to bus users.
In order to solve these problems and enhance current bus service system, real time bus tracking
system has to develop and implement. With real time bus tracking system, bus position data is
connected real time and transmitted to a central server for processing and extracting transit
information. The main technology used to develop this system is Global Positioning System
(GPS). GPS technology able to receives the position of an object from space-based satellite
navigation system through a GPS receiver.
